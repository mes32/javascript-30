# 05 - Flex Panel Gallery

## Todo

- Use CSS `flex` attribute to set panel widths instead of `width`
- Use CSS relative translate to move text out of view instead of negative padding
- Start the text transition off the end of the panel transition

## Notes

- It is possible to chain CSS transitions by adding a listener for transition end events
- Negative padding isn't the cleanest way to move elements out of view
- The CSS `flex` attribute can be used to set the relative size of items inside a flex-box container
