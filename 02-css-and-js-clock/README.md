# 02 - CSS and JavaScript Clock

## Notes 

- Learned that I need to use `setInterval()` for the continuous update loop. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setInterval
- Got a little more comfortable working with CSS `position: relative`. See https://blog.webdevsimplified.com/2022-01/css-position/
- It is possible to hand edit and export CSS cubic bezier curves from the browser developer tools
- Can quickly get favicons based on emoticons using https://fav.farm/
